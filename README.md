# DM Helper
## Getting started:

### On Android:
Download the Expo Go app on the play store
### On iOS:
I think you're just good with the camera app

### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the Dev server on a physical device

OK, this is the really cool part. First: 
```
npm start
```
Then, 
on Android, go into the Expo Go app and pick the option to scan QR code.
On iOS, open the camera app. There should be a QR code right there in the CLI terminal. Scroll up a bit if you don't see it.

### OR

### Run the Dev server on a virtual device

Set up the virtual Android or iOS device according to respective docs.

Run the Expo command pertinent to send the app to the virtual device (a for Android or i for iOS)

### Start editing and see the app change! 

If it doesn't auto-reload, press 'r' in the dev server terminal window.
